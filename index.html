                Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
                morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion
                and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however
                learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any
                experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered
                educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

                A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions,
                education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular
                for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal
                4, which promotes quality education for all.

                According to current estimate, 29% of Indian children are privately educated. With more than 50%
                children enrolling in private schools in urban areas, the balance has already tilted towards private
                schooling in cities; and, even in rural areas, nearly 20% of the children in 2004-5 were enrolled in
                private schools.
                La Martiniere Calcutta, regarded as one of the best schools in the country
                Global Public School, one of the top international schools in South India
                Most middle-class families send their children to private schools, which might be in their own city
                or at distant boarding schools. Private schools have been established since the British Rule in India
                and St George's School, Chennai is the oldest private school in India. At such schools, the medium
                of education is often English, but Hindi and/or the state's official language is also taught as a
                compulsory subject. Pre-school education is mostly limited to organised neighbourhood nursery
                schools with some organised chains.[citation needed] Montessori education is also popular, due to Maria
                Montessori's stay in India during World War II. In 2014, four of the top ten pre-schools in Chennai were
                Montessori.

                Many privately owned and managed schools carry the appellation "Public", such as the Delhi Public
                Schools, or Frank Anthony Public Schools. These are modelled after British public schools, which are a
                group of older, expensive and exclusive fee-paying private independent schools in England.

                From the first Five-year Plan onwards, India's emphasis was to develop a pool of scientifically inclined
                manpower.[91] India's National Policy on Education (NPE) provisioned for an apex body for regulation and
                development of higher technical education, which came into being as the All India Council for Technical
                Education (AICTE) in 1987 through an act of the Indian parliament.[92] At the federal level, the Indian
                Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, the National Institutes
                of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Information Technology are deemed of national importance.[92]
                The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are among the
                nation's premier education facilities.

                The UGC has inter-university centres at a number of locations throughout India to promote common
                research, e.g. the Nuclear Science Centre at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.[93] Besides
                there are some British established colleges such as Harcourt Butler Technological Institute situated in
                Kanpur and King George Medical University situated in Lucknow which are important centre of higher
                education.
